# SeleniumMysql
Selenium for web scraping and storing in MySQL


The repo contains two files: Ipython notebook and a Python file. Both solve the same use case.
Notebook was used while researching and Python file is used for packaging the code.

I've also added chrome webdriver (though not necessary as I'm handling it's dependency in the code itself).

This code is used to fetch a dummy solar website.
